**Git Reference - Advancing with Components and Data Binding**

**1. Introduction**
   - Building on the basics and project setup.
   - Focusing on components and data binding.

**2. Key Objectives**
   - Learn to connect components and data binding.
   - Take a significant step forward in app development.

**3. Example Project**
   - Attached in the next lecture.
   - Enhance the project using components and data binding.

**4. Application Progress**
   - Use components and data binding to improve the app.
   - Example: Connecting components to display dynamic content.

In this guide, we highlight the importance of components and data binding in Angular app development, providing a foundation for advancing your skills. The example project will help you grasp these concepts effectively.


**Git Reference - Splitting Angular Components**

**1. Introduction**
   - Overview of breaking a monolithic component into smaller components.

**2. Example Project**
   - Initial app with a single component, containing both logic and HTML.

**3. Splitting Components**
   - Create new components: "cockpit" and "server element."
   - Use Angular CLI to generate components (`ng generate component` or `ng g c`).
   - Remove auto-generated spec files if not needed.

**4. Reorganizing Code**
   - Move HTML code for cockpit to the new cockpit component.
   - Relocate methods, e.g., `onAppServer` and `onAppBlueprint`, from the app component to the cockpit component.
   - Important: Maintain `serverElements` array in the app component.

**5. Managing Data**
   - Handle data transfer between components.
   - Pass data from the cockpit component to the app component (e.g., a new server).
   - Use Angular concepts for data communication (not shown in the provided transcript).

In this guide, we explore the process of splitting Angular components to improve code organization and maintain data communication between them. While the transcript doesn't provide specific Angular data communication examples, it's essential to delve deeper into Angular's data-binding and communication mechanisms for a complete understanding.
