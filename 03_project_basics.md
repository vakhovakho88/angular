**Git Reference: Introduction to Course Project - Recipe Book & Shopping List App**

**1. Project Overview:**
   
- The course project aims to create a **Recipe Book & Shopping List App**.
- Main Features:
   1. **Recipe Book**: Manage and view recipes in detail.
   2. **Shopping List**: Maintain and manage ingredients. 

**2. Application's Core Features:**

   - Two main sections: **Shopping List** and **Recipe Book**.
   - Ability to push ingredients from a recipe directly into the shopping list.

**3. Importance of Planning:**

- Before diving into building, it's crucial to plan the app.
- **Example**:
    ```text
    Recipe Book:
       - Display Recipe List
       - View Single Recipe Details
       - Edit Recipe
       
    Shopping List:
       - List Ingredients
       - Add/Remove Ingredients
       - Import Ingredients from Recipe
    ```

**4. Next Steps:**

- The subsequent phase involves planning components for each feature to ensure a modular and maintainable app structure.

**Git Reference: Planning and Structuring an Angular App**

**1. Importance of Structuring:**

- Before coding, layout and structure of an app should be planned.
- It's common to evolve this structure as the app develops.

**2. Example App: Recipe Book & Shopping List**

- Features:
    - **Recipe Book**: Manage recipes with details.
    - **Shopping List**: Manage shopping items.

**3. Components Planning:**

- **Root Component (`app`)**: Holds the overall app.
- **Header Component**: 
    - For navigation between the two main sections.
    - Contains logic like routing and possibly dropdowns for server operations.

**Example Structure for Shopping List:**
   ```text
   ShoppingListComponent
   ├── ShoppingListEditComponent (for adding new items)
   ```

**Example Structure for Recipe Book:**
   ```text
   RecipeListComponent
   ├── RecipeItemComponent (individual recipe)
   ├── RecipeDetailComponent (details for selected recipe)
   ```

**4. Data Models and Their Importance:**

- Define clear data models to facilitate component communication.
- For the app:
    - **Ingredient Model**: e.g., `{ name: 'Apple', amount: 5 }`.
    - **Recipe Model**: e.g., `{ title: 'Apple Pie', description: 'Delicious pie', ingredients: [...] }`.

**5. Takeaways and Next Steps:**

- Planning components around the core functionalities is crucial.
- Components should ideally focus on a single main task.
- Defining clear data models helps in maintaining uniformity and clarity.
- With the structure in place, the next step is implementing components and populating them with dummy data.

Git Reference:

**Key Points:**
- Set up a project with Bootstrap in the previous lecture.
- Task is to create Angular components manually and structure them cleverly.
- Create components with decorators, selectors, and templates.
- Manually register components in the app module.
- Organize components by feature in folders.
- Use the Angular CLI for some components.

**Example:**
1. **Creating a Header Component Manually:**
   - Create a new folder named 'header' inside the 'app' folder.
   - Inside the 'header' folder, add a 'header.component.ts' file.
   - In 'header.component.ts', define the component with the `@Component` decorator:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-header',
  templateUrl: './header.component.html',
})
export class HeaderComponent {
  // Add component logic here
}
```

- Create a new file 'header.component.html' in the 'header' folder and add content to it:

```html
<!-- header.component.html -->
<header>
  <!-- Add header content here -->
</header>
```

- Register the 'HeaderComponent' in the 'app.module.ts' by importing and adding it to the 'declarations' array:

```typescript
import { HeaderComponent } from './header/header.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    // Other components
    HeaderComponent, // Add HeaderComponent here
  ],
  // Other module configuration
})
```

2. **Using the Angular CLI for Recipe Components:**
   - Use the Angular CLI to generate components for recipes.
   - Run the following commands to create components inside appropriate folders:

```bash
ng generate component recipes --skip-tests
ng generate component recipes/recipe-list --skip-tests
ng generate component recipes/recipe-detail --skip-tests
ng generate component recipes/recipe-list/recipe-item --skip-tests
```

   - The components will be automatically registered in the 'app.module.ts' when generated by the CLI.

3. **Using the Angular CLI for Shopping List Components:**
   - Use the Angular CLI to generate components for the shopping list.
   - Run the following commands to create components inside appropriate folders:

```bash
ng generate component shopping-list --skip-tests
ng generate component shopping-list/shopping-edit --skip-tests
```

   - The components will be automatically registered in the 'app.module.ts' when generated by the CLI.
