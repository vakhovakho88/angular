**Git Reference: Introduction to Course Project - Recipe Book & Shopping List App**

**1. Project Overview:**
   
- The course project aims to create a **Recipe Book & Shopping List App**.
- Main Features:
   1. **Recipe Book**: Manage and view recipes in detail.
   2. **Shopping List**: Maintain and manage ingredients. 

**2. Application's Core Features:**

   - Two main sections: **Shopping List** and **Recipe Book**.
   - Ability to push ingredients from a recipe directly into the shopping list.

**3. Importance of Planning:**

- Before diving into building, it's crucial to plan the app.
- **Example**:
    ```text
    Recipe Book:
       - Display Recipe List
       - View Single Recipe Details
       - Edit Recipe
       
    Shopping List:
       - List Ingredients
       - Add/Remove Ingredients
       - Import Ingredients from Recipe
    ```

**4. Next Steps:**

- The subsequent phase involves planning components for each feature to ensure a modular and maintainable app structure.

**Git Reference: Planning and Structuring an Angular App**

**1. Importance of Structuring:**

- Before coding, layout and structure of an app should be planned.
- It's common to evolve this structure as the app develops.

**2. Example App: Recipe Book & Shopping List**

- Features:
    - **Recipe Book**: Manage recipes with details.
    - **Shopping List**: Manage shopping items.

**3. Components Planning:**

- **Root Component (`app`)**: Holds the overall app.
- **Header Component**: 
    - For navigation between the two main sections.
    - Contains logic like routing and possibly dropdowns for server operations.

**Example Structure for Shopping List:**
   ```text
   ShoppingListComponent
   ├── ShoppingListEditComponent (for adding new items)
   ```

**Example Structure for Recipe Book:**
   ```text
   RecipeListComponent
   ├── RecipeItemComponent (individual recipe)
   ├── RecipeDetailComponent (details for selected recipe)
   ```

**4. Data Models and Their Importance:**

- Define clear data models to facilitate component communication.
- For the app:
    - **Ingredient Model**: e.g., `{ name: 'Apple', amount: 5 }`.
    - **Recipe Model**: e.g., `{ title: 'Apple Pie', description: 'Delicious pie', ingredients: [...] }`.

**5. Takeaways and Next Steps:**

- Planning components around the core functionalities is crucial.
- Components should ideally focus on a single main task.
- Defining clear data models helps in maintaining uniformity and clarity.
- With the structure in place, the next step is implementing components and populating them with dummy data.
