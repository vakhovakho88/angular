# New practical excercise:
Hello, I'm embarking on my journey to learn Angular and aim to transition from a beginner to a proficient developer. Having completed a basic tutorial on Angular, I've grasped the fundamentals such as components and basic data binding. My goal is to build practical, real-world projects that will solidify my understanding of Angular and introduce me to more complex concepts such as services, RxJS, and form handling. I am looking for project suggestions that are manageable in scope yet challenging enough to push my boundaries and enhance my skills.


**Angular Learning Project Request**

1. **Current Skill Level:** [Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced]
   - Briefly describe what concepts or parts of Angular you are already familiar with.

2. **Areas of Interest:** [Components, Services, RxJS, Angular Material, etc.]
   - Mention any specific Angular features or concepts you are interested in or feel you need more practice with.

3. **Previous Projects or Exercises Completed:**
   - If applicable, briefly describe any projects or exercises you've already done, so I can tailor the next project to avoid repetition and ensure progression.

4. **Learning Objectives:**
   - Specify what you aim to achieve with the next project (e.g., understanding how to manage state in Angular applications, getting comfortable with RxJS observables).

5. **Time Commitment:**
   - Indicate how much time you're willing to spend on this project, so I can adjust the complexity accordingly.

6. **Additional Requirements or Preferences:**
   - Any specific requirements (e.g., must use Angular Material) or preferences (e.g., a preference for projects related to e-commerce, blogging platforms, etc.).
